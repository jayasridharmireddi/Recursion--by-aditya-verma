this q.s is more like an observation question rater than a coding question. k- place of the symbol and n is the level in the grammar.

ex of the grammar is:

0
01
0110
01101001
0110100110010110

if u see here- grammar of half of nth level is the same as n-1 th level and after half it is the compliment of n-1 th level
int mid---  (2^n-1)/2
so the code goes ----          if(n==1){ 
                                  return 0;
                               }
                               else if(k<=mid){
                                   grammar(n-1,k);
                               }
                               else{
                                  ~(grammar(n-1,k));
                               }
